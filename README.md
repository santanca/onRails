Description:
Inspired by the classic on-rails shooter game Time Crisis, Target Crisis follows a similar theme in putting you, the player, on the rails of a high stakes mission to get to the end. 

Your mission, should you choose to accept, is to clear each stage with the highest possible score by eliminating your enemies and targets as quickly as possible. Clearing one sub area will grant you access to the next sub area (there are 10 sub areas total). Although it sounds simple, your enemies will not hesitate to fire back! Good luck and we’ll see you on the other side.
This game was developed in c++ and OpenGL.
