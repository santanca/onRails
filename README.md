Description:
Inspired by the classic on-rails shooter game Time Crisis, Target Crisis was developed in c++ and OpenGL. The objective of the game is to clear the stage with the highest possible score by shooting the targets and enemies as fast as you can. Clearing one sub area will grant you access to the next sub area (there are 10 sub areas total). Also be careful on your journey as the enemies will try to shoot you!
